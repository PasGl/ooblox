# ooblox

ooblox is a 3D sandbox framework in its infancy.

## Why ?

I want to have a framework like this.
It allows me to quickly develop and deploy 3D toys, games, experiments, visualizations and applications.
Having them all in a common framework means these 3D "things" can be combined and reused conveniently.

(still in the process of cleaning up before initial github upload)
